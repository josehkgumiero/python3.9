# Packages

- Packages are a way of structuring many modules;
- Helps in a wall-organized hierarchy of data set;
- Making the directories and modules easy to access;
- Helps us in storing other sub-packages and modules;

# Creating Packages

- We creates a file named ``__init__.py`` inside it folder;
- It is considered as a package;
- We may creates other modules and sub-packages within it.
- First, we create a directory and give it a package name, preferably related to its operation.
- Then we put the classes and the required functions in it.
- Finally we create an ``__init__.py`` file inside the directory, to let Python know that the directory is a package.
