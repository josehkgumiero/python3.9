# What is a Framework?

- A Python framework is a collection of modues that provides a set of common functionality that can e used as a structure for building applications;
- Framework is designed to provide a general guideline on how should build software and abstracting away some task;
- The difference between the framework and the library, it is the library has amount of function that are used in the around of the applicaton. So the framework is more completed and complex to programming;
- Frameworks make our software developer's job easier, promote code organization, it can increase productivity;

# Types of Framework

- Full-Stack;
- Microframework;
- Asynchronous;
- GUI;
- Machine Learning;
- Scientific Computing;
- Testing

# Python Package Manager (pip)

- If you have already installed Python, you have access to pip's command line interface, which allows you to install Python packages;
- You can install any package available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) with the following command:
```
pip install package-name
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
